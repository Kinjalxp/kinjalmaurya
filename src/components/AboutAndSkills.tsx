        <p className="text-black leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Rutgers State
          University with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and
          continuous learning. My interest in computing began at a young age and
          has developed through both academic study and hands-on exploration. I
          am currently pursuing the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to
          strengthen my understanding of cloud technologies and scalable
          systems. Outside of technology, I enjoy reading in my free time, which
          helps me maintain perspective and encourages thoughtful thinking.
